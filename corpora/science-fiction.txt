The last sunrise on Mars was not red, but violet—tainted by particles from the fusion mines below the crust. Captain Alira stood at the edge of Observatory Deck 17, staring into the distant shimmer of Olympus Mons, now half-excavated by autonomous harvesters. "Gravity is thinner today," remarked Eno, the ship’s AI, its voice modulating through the vibration panels. "Atmospheric density has dropped by 0.2 percent. Local systems are destabilizing." Alira tapped her wristpad, holographic glyphs flickering to life in the dusty air. “Run a sector sweep,” she commanded. “Focus on geological tremors near Vault Theta.” "Confirmed," Eno replied. “Subsurface anomaly detected. Coordinates locked. Something’s… pulsing.” She frowned. Vault Theta was sealed since the First Terraforming War. No one went there—not after the incident with the whispering drones and the mirror-skin entity that mimicked voices from Earth. The crew—what was left of it—was uneasy. Lieutenant Rho paced between cryopod rows, muttering equations in Old Syntax. Veda, the linguist, sketched alien phonemes on her forearm with a stylus made of bone. Even the androids moved slower, as if aware of the coming shift. At precisely 19:07 Martian standard time, the tremor hit. Instruments spiked. Lights flickered. The air thickened with static. And then, the voice came—not through speakers, but inside minds. "Child of carbon, why do you pierce our sleep?" The glyphs on Alira’s wristpad rearranged themselves into a language no one had seen in ten thousand years.
