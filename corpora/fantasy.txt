In the heart of a vast and whispering forest, where the trees stretched endlessly toward the pale sky, a gentle wind stirred the leaves in rhythmic cadence. Moss crept across twisted roots, and sunlight trickled through branches like scattered gold. Creatures moved unseen in the underbrush—deer with eyes like polished amber, foxes whose paws left no sound, and owls who ruled the dusk with solemn stares. Human presence was rare, but not forgotten. Stone ruins dotted the woodland like fossils of an older age, moss-veiled and ivy-bound, their meanings eroded by time. No one remembered who built them. Yet travelers sometimes came—scholars, wanderers, those fleeing wars or seeking visions in dreamlike solitude. A young woman named Elira, her boots soaked from dew and mud, arrived one twilight carrying little more than a journal and a compass. Her hair was tied back with string, and her eyes, dark and alert, scanned the trail for the unseen. Her journal bore sketches of constellations and notes in languages dead to the modern world. She was not lost—at least, not in the ordinary sense. She was searching for something old, something half-remembered in tales told by candlelight: the Mirror of Inetheris, a relic said to reflect not one's face, but one's fate. Elira’s journey spanned a dozen villages, countless paths, and more than one sleepless night under the canopy of stars. She met a blind cartographer who mapped by memory, a hermit who spoke to the stones, and children who danced beneath trees that bloomed out of season. Every encounter added another thread to the tapestry of her quest. Words, phrases, dialects shifted around her like streams diverging in a delta, yet she adapted, listening for patterns, finding fragments of forgotten tongues. One day, deep in a glade where silence settled like snow, she found it: a circular pond no larger than a room, surrounded by stone markers etched in runes. The water was impossibly still. No wind rippled its surface, and no reflection showed except her own shadow self—silent, waiting. She knelt, her heart pounding like a drum, and whispered a name not spoken aloud in centuries. The wind rose suddenly, as if exhaling a secret. The mirror shimmered. And so began the part of her story that even Elira could not write.
